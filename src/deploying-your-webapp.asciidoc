== Deploying your Webapp

I can't speak for others, but I personally prefer programming to system
administration. But the fact is that, eventually, you need to serve your app
somehow, and odds are that you'll need to be the one to set it up.

There are some promising initiatives in the Haskell web community towards
making deployment easier. In the future, we may even have a service that allows
you to deploy your app with a single command.

But we're not there yet. And even if we were, such a solution will never work
for everyone. This chapter covers the different options you have for
deployment, and gives some general recommendations on what you should choose in
different situations.

NOTE: While the information in this chapter is not Yesod-version-dependent, I
don't necessarily believe that all of the recommendations given here are
accurate given more recent developments, such as FP Complete's
application server, or the availability of Keter. I've left this chapter mostly
unchanged, but will likely update it again in the coming months. (June 23,
2013)

=== Compiling

First things first: how do you build your production application? If you're
using the scaffolded site, it's as simple as +cabal build+. I also recommend
cleaning beforehand to make sure there is no cached information, so a simple
combination to build your executable is:

----
cabal clean && cabal configure && cabal build
----

=== Files to deploy

With a Yesod scaffolded application, there are essentially three sets of files that need
to be deployed:

. Your executable.
. The config folder.
. The static folder.

Everything else, such as Shakespearean templates, gets compiled into the
executable itself.

There is one caveat, however: the +config/client_session_key.aes+ file. This
file controls the server side encryption used for securing client side session
cookies. Yesod will automatically generate a new one of these keys if none is
present. In practice, this means that, if you do not include this file in
deployment, all of your users will have to log in again when you redeploy. If
you follow the advice above and include the +config+ folder, this issue will be
partially resolved.

The other half of the resolution is to ensure that once you generate a
+config/client_session_key.aes+ file, you keep the same one for all future
deployments. The simplest way to ensure this is to keep that file in your
version control. However, if your version control is open source, this will be
dangerous: anyone with access to your repository will be able to spoof login
credentials!

The problem described here is essentially one of system administration, not
programming. Yesod does not provide any built-in approach for securely storing
client session keys. If you have an open source repository, or do not trust
everyone who has access to your source code repository, it's vital to figure
out a safe storage solution for the client session key.

=== Warp

As we have mentioned before, Yesod is built on the Web Application Interface
(WAI), allowing it to run on any WAI backend. At the time of writing, the
following backends are available:

* Warp
* FastCGI
* SCGI
* CGI
* Webkit
* Development server

The last two are not intended for production deployments. Of the remaining
four, all can be used for production deployment in theory. In practice, a CGI
backend will likely be horribly inefficient, since a new process must be
spawned for each connection. And SCGI is not nearly as well supported by
frontend web servers as Warp (via reverse proxying) or FastCGI.

So between the two remaining choices, Warp gets a very strong recommendation
because:


* It is significantly faster.
* Like FastCGI, it can run behind a frontend server like Nginx, using reverse
  HTTP proxy.
* In addition, it is a fully capable server of its own accord, and can
  therefore be used without any frontend server.

So that leaves one last question: should Warp run on its own, or via reverse
proxy behind a frontend server? For most use cases, I recommend the latter,
because:

* As fast as Warp is, it is still optimized as an application server, not a
  static file server.
* Using Nginx, you can set up virtual hosting to serve your static contents
  from a separate domain. (It's possible to do this with Warp, but a bit more
  involved).
* You can use Nginx as either a load balancer or a SSL proxy. (Though with
  warp-tls it's entirely possible to run an https site on Warp alone.)

So my final recommendation is: set up Nginx to reverse proxy to Warp.

NOTE: A number of people in the Yesod community disagree with me here, and
believe that the increased performance and decreased complexity of skipping the
Nginx step make standalone Warp a better choice. Feel free to follow either
approach, they are both perfectly valid.

==== Configuration

In general, Nginx will listen on port 80 and your Yesod/Warp app will listen on
some unprivileged port (lets say 4321). You will then need to provide a
nginx.conf file, such as:

----
daemon off; # Don't run nginx in the background, good for monitoring apps
events {
    worker_connections 4096;
}

http {
    server {
        listen 80; # Incoming port for Nginx
        server_name www.myserver.com;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4321; # Reverse proxy to your Yesod app
        }
    }
}
----

You can add as many server blocks as you like. A common addition is to ensure
users always access your pages with the www prefix on the domain name, ensuring
the RESTful principle of canonical URLs. (You could just as easily do the
opposite and always strip the www, just make sure that your choice is reflected
in both the nginx config and the approot of your site.) In this case, we would
add the block:

----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myserver.com;
    rewrite ^/(.*) http://www.myserver.com/$1 permanent;
}
----

A highly recommended optimization is to serve static files from a separate
domain name, therefore bypassing the cookie transfer overhead. Assuming that
our static files are stored in the +static+ folder within our site folder, and
the site folder is located at +/home/michael/sites/mysite+, this would look
like:

----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name static.myserver.com;
    root /home/michael/sites/mysite/static;
    # Since yesod-static appends a content hash in the query string,
    # we are free to set expiration dates far in the future without
    # concerns of stale content.
    expires max;
}
----

In order for this to work, your site must properly rewrite static URLs to this
alternate domain name. The scaffolded site is set up to make this fairly simple
via the +Settings.staticRoot+ function and the definition of
+urlRenderOverride+. However, if you just want to get the benefit of nginx's
faster static file serving without dealing with separate domain names, you can
instead modify your original server block like so:

----
server {
    listen 80; # Incoming port for Nginx
    server_name www.myserver.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4321; # Reverse proxy to your Yesod app
    }
    location /static {
        root /home/michael/sites/mysite; # Notice that we do *not* include /static
        expires max;
    }
}
----

==== Server Process

Many people are familiar with an Apache/mod_php or Lighttpd/FastCGI kind of
setup, where the web server automatically spawns the web application. With
nginx, either for reverse proxying or FastCGI, this is not the case: you are
responsible to run your own process. I strongly recommend a monitoring utility
which will automatically restart your application in case it crashes. There are
many great options out there, such as angel or daemontools.

To give a concrete example, here is an Upstart config file. The file must be
placed in +/etc/init/mysite.conf+:

----
description "My awesome Yesod application"
start on runlevel [2345];
stop on runlevel [!2345];
respawn
chdir /home/michael/sites/mysite
exec /home/michael/sites/mysite/dist/build/mysite/mysite
----

Once this is in place, bringing up your application is as simple as +sudo start
mysite+.

=== FastCGI

Some people may prefer using FastCGI for deployment. In this case, you'll need
to add an extra tool to the mix. FastCGI works by receiving new connection from
a file descriptor. The C library assumes that this file descriptor will be 0
(standard input), so you need to use the spawn-fcgi program to bind your
application's standard input to the correct socket.

It can be very convenient to use Unix named sockets for this instead of binding
to a port, especially when hosting multiple applications on a single host. A
possible script to load up your app could be:

----
spawn-fcgi \
    -d /home/michael/sites/mysite \
    -s /tmp/mysite.socket \
    -n \
    -M 511 \
    -u michael \
    -- /home/michael/sites/mysite/dist/build/mysite-fastcgi/mysite-fastcgi
----

You will also need to configure your frontend server to speak to your app over
FastCGI. This is relatively painless in Nginx:

----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.myserver.com;
    location / {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/mysite.socket;
    }
}
----

That should look pretty familiar from above. The only last trick is that, with
Nginx, you need to manually specify all of the FastCGI variables. It is
recommended to store these in a separate file (say, fastcgi.conf) and then add
+include fastcgi.conf;+ to the end of your http block. The contents of the
file, to work with WAI, should be:

----
fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;
fastcgi_param  PATH_INFO          $fastcgi_script_name;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;
fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx/$nginx_version;
fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;
----

=== Desktop

Another nifty backend is wai-handler-webkit. This backend combines Warp and
QtWebkit to create an executable that a user simply double-clicks. This can be
a convenient way to provide an offline version of your application.

One of the very nice conveniences of Yesod for this is that your templates are
all compiled into the executable, and thus do not need to be distributed with
your application. Static files do, however.


NOTE: There's actually support for embedding your static files directly in the
executable as well, see the yesod-static docs for more details.

A similar approach, without requiring the QtWebkit library, is
wai-handler-launch, which launches a Warp server and then opens up the user's
default web browser. There's a little trickery involved here: in order to know
that the user is still using the site, +wai-handler-launch+  inserts a "ping"
Javascript snippet to every HTML page it serves. It +wai-handler-launch+
doesn't receive a ping for two minutes, it shuts down.

=== CGI on Apache

CGI and FastCGI work almost identically on Apache, so it should be fairly
straight-forward to port this configuration. You essentially need to accomplish
two goals:

. Get the server to serve your file as (Fast)CGI.
. Rewrite all requests to your site to go through the (Fast)CGI executable.

Here is a configuration file for serving a blog application, with an executable
named "bloggy.cgi", living in a subfolder named "blog" of the document root.
This example was taken from an application living in the path
+/f5/snoyman/public/blog+.

----
Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
Options +FollowSymlinks

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/f5/snoyman/public/blog$ /blog/ [R=301,S=1]
RewriteCond $1 !^bloggy.cgi
RewriteCond $1 !^static/
RewriteRule ^(.*) bloggy.cgi/$1 [L]
----

The first RewriteRule is to deal with subfolders. In particular, it redirects a
request for +/blog+ to +/blog/+. The first RewriteCond prevents directly
requesting the executable, the second allows Apache to serve the static files,
and the last line does the actual rewriting.

=== FastCGI on lighttpd

For this example, I've left off some of the basic FastCGI settings like
mime-types. I also have a more complex file in production that prepends "www."
when absent and serves static files from a separate domain. However, this
should serve to show the basics.

Here, "/home/michael/fastcgi" is the fastcgi application. The idea is to
rewrite all requests to start with "/app", and then serve everything beginning
with "/app" via the FastCGI executable.

----
server.port = 3000
server.document-root = "/home/michael"
server.modules = ("mod_fastcgi", "mod_rewrite")

url.rewrite-once = (
  "(.*)" => "/app/$1"
)

fastcgi.server = (
    "/app" => ((
        "socket" => "/tmp/test.fastcgi.socket",
        "check-local" => "disable",
        "bin-path" => "/home/michael/fastcgi", # full path to executable
        "min-procs" => 1,
        "max-procs" => 30,
        "idle-timeout" => 30
    ))
)
----

=== CGI on lighttpd

This is basically the same as the FastCGI version, but tells lighttpd to run a
file ending in ".cgi" as a CGI executable. In this case, the file lives at
"/home/michael/myapp.cgi".

----
server.port = 3000
server.document-root = "/home/michael"
server.modules = ("mod_cgi", "mod_rewrite")

url.rewrite-once = (
    "(.*)" => "/myapp.cgi/$1"
)

cgi.assign = (".cgi" => "")
----
